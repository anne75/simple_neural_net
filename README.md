# Simple Neural Network
Single hidden layer neural net in C++ adapted from Coursera Machine Learning.  

[AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) is a buzzword of our times. It's everywhere, and it sounds both really 
cool and super smart. It is also regularly accompanied with *something* neural network. I wanted to know more, or more accurately remember about it.   
As I was trying to see if I liked programming 3 years ago I took the first class that was opened at [UCSC Extension](https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/), and it was about machine learning.
I thoroughly enjoyed that class, and went on to take more classes both at the UCSC extension and online before attending Holberton School.
One of those courses was the famous (Machine Learning)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning] on Coursera.   
I decided this spring after much coding which had nothing to do with data, but a lot with me learning, to loop the loop and try to re-code
the course neural network but this time in C++.  
Why C++ ? Mostly to learn a new language, and I had heard it had great linear algebra libraries.
Here is my attempt.  
In the folder, the class assignment as I did it 3 years ago.  
- neural_network.cpp: all the neural netowrk related functions.
